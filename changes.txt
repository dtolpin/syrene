    alternative hypotheses done; seems to work and give good information.
    Now let's describe what is done -- write papers.

Wed Apr 25 14:13:19 IDT 2007
    sydiff is implemented - a command-line utility that takes
    new and old network and a list of cases and displays cases
    for which explanations differ.

Tue Apr 24 23:28:15 IDT 2007
    I need a tool that displays a list of cases affected by differences
    between two versions of the questionnaire. The tool takes old version,
    new version and a list of cases and returns a list of cases with different
    explanations.

    It is probably worth making it a command-line utility along with a function
    in Sysh.

Sun Apr 22 16:50:20 IDT 2007
    Active dialogue done. Utility is logged to stderr (that is, to httpd-error.log).
    Next is development tools.

Sun Apr  8 03:31:38 IDT 2007
    String values are numerically bi-valued (0,1). Ana is drafted.
    Next is Acti.

Fri Apr  6 16:30:07 IDT 2007
    Exposed questions work.

Fri Apr  6 02:11:35 IDT 2007
    Evidence domain (Ana.domains). Next is exposed questions.

Tue Apr  3 23:37:25 IDT 2007
    Active dialogue: the utility is the sum of all syndromes. It is log [P(all up)/P(all down)].
    To optimize, need domains for every evidence variable.

    Alternative hypotheses: sum of all (l-o) -- it is log [P(in this state)/P(in inverse state)].

    Foundation for these criteria? A hypothesis is that in complex systems, inverse state
    is virtually random and with low probability.

Mon Apr  2 00:56:02 IDT 2007
    Form.lhs is built on Traverse.lhs; the next step is metric computation.

Tue Mar 20 23:47:08 IST 2007
    The form generator is in the process of refactoring. Try to implement
    evidence dependencies.

Sun Jan 21 02:30:42 AMT 2007
    Anna is a good performer; next step: search by syndrome queries
    to facilitate network debugging.

Tue Jan 16 02:07:01 AMT 2007
    NetMisconf, index through ErrorT.

Sun Jan 14 01:10:41 AMT 2007
    ForeignBug drafted (even gives reasonable response).

Fri Jan 12 01:38:02 AMT 2007
    First hypothesis is breathing.

Tue Jan  9 20:46:12 AMT 2007
    Network visualization via GraphViz.

Mon Jan  8 15:41:18 AMT 2007
    syndromes in questionnaire are functional (but are not used yet).
    Next step is to manually define syndromes and hypotheses.
    
Sun Jan  7 22:19:01 AMT 2007
    entered 300 cases into ANNA-SUPPORT database.

Wed Jan  3 20:07:57 AMT 2007
    text generation for case description complete.
    Dependency on HaXml (temporary) removed.

Tue Jan  2 02:04:45 AMT 2007
    experiment in progress: ~120 cases
    text generation in Haskell drafted. 

    Next step: symbol table for questionnaire to generate
    explanation in Haskell CGI.

Fri Dec 29 02:35:11 AMT 2006
    everything is ready for the experiment.

Wed Dec 27 14:54:45 AMT 2006
    qre.lhs -- skeleton.
    Next steps: populator, javascript for collapsing and expanding
    just the questionnaire, probably without vartable yet.

Wed Dec 27 02:39:45 AMT 2006
    New modules: CGI, HTML.
    Additions to anna.synet -- just to see how it goes.
    mergeform in Sysh -- to compile standalone questionnaires.

Mon Dec 25 00:03:15 AMT 2006
    HTML part of the questionnaire is done; Regexp is removed
    from the source, no need for. Basic javascript to compose the tree.
    Now: css and js go to separate files (form.css, form.js) and an
         utility to compile html+css+js into a single document,
         collapsing/expanding (later),
         server-side cgi to gather information.

Tue Dec 19 23:57:55 AMT 2006
    HTML part of the questionnaire is mostly done.

    Next step is dynamic tree:
      Expansions are managed by JavaScript. A function traverses the tree
      and sets display:none on all disabled branches (and does not go inside).
      On enabled branches it will insert referenced sections.

Mon Dec 18 00:25:21 AMT 2006
    Html serializer skeleton.

Sat Dec 16 23:15:12 AMT 2006
    Next step is data input facility. Two things:
      1) questionnaire generator - just simple HTML.
      2) CGI script. Path info points to questionnaire,
         then interview number: quest.cgi/anna/502

         anna/ contains
            1) form.html (and other support files in the future). 
            2) numerically named data files in the form of CGI
               query strings (anna/502 is for interview #502). 

         CGI script writes updated data file when -submit-= in the query and
         returns form with data filled in.
     Will use HaXml for form-filling and a home-brewn cgi implementation.

Wed Dec 13 03:52:18 AMT 2006
    Testing framework, tests for modules.
    Shell for basic manipulations (Sysh).
    Skeleton for the questionnaire generation module.

Fri Dec  8 04:38:11 AMT 2006
    parser works on anna.synet, next is tests for the parser,
    then -- drawing the HTML.

Thu Dec  7 04:15:38 AMT 2006
    src/Parse.lhs -- parser in progress

Tue Dec  5 05:16:48 AMT 2006
    src/Synet.lhs -- basic structures and selector composition

Sun Dec  3 15:40:39 AMT 2006
    net/anna.synet drafted. exa/0.synet contains syntax patterns.

Sat Dec  2 20:38:31 AMT 2006
    Module created
